## About Hacktoberfest and Open-Source Contribution
Hacktoberfest is DigitalOceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open-source throughout October. Everyone can contribute to open-source whether a tech person or a non-tech person. One can contribute to documentation, improve the source code, add some elements to UI/UX, debug some erroneous code and more things you can do to the existing projects. You can also put your projects and make the repository public to available as open-source. Open-source means that the source code is open for all, everyone can read it, make changes and improve it and collab in the project after reviewing by the maintainer of the project. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to the projects, sharpening skills, and diving into the open-source community.
